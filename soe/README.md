# Service Orchestration Engine (SOE) samples 
-------------------
The Service Orchestration Engine (SOE) provides a simple way to customize the behavior of the IBM Voice Gateway / Voice Agent with Watson. It acts as a Watson Conversation proxy that sits between the IBM Voice Gateway/Voice Agent and the Watson Conversation service, modifying request sent from the voice gateway to Watson and modifying responses sent back to the voice gateway/Voice Agent from Watson:

Most production deployments of the IBM Voice Gateway/Voice Agent will need an SOE for the following reasons:

 - De-identification of Watson Conversation requests
 - Personalize the Watson Conversation responses
 - Use telephony features like Caller-id, DTMF, etc.
 - Integrate with APIâ€™s to enhance the user interaction
 - Exploit Voice Gateway features using state variables 
 - Voice security integration using DTMF or biometrics

In this directory you will find samples for the SOE written in various languages. Currently, there is a Python, Java (on WebSphere Liberty) and Javascript (on Node-RED for Node.js).
