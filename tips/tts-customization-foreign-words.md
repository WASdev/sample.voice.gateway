Sometimes Watson TTS will not be able to synthesize foreign words correctly.
There are at least 2 ways to approach that:

1. Easier route: One can write the word as it sounds in the target TTS Voice. For instance, if the English word "Voice" would be used in a German voice de-DE_Birgit, it could be written as "Voiss" and provide a closer result to the desired pronunciation. Other  examples are "Watson" which could be written "Uats-SSon"; or "Center" could be written "SSenter" (for the same German voice de-DE_Birgit.

2. A more elaborate route:  Sometimes the easier route will not work well. In those cases, one needs to use TTS customization. For example, "Knowledge" could be written ` <phoneme alphabet="ibm" ph="nolEdZ"> Knowledge </phoneme> ` .
