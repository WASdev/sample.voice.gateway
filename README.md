# sample.voice.gateway.for.watson

This repository contains various samples and scripts to help you get started with the **BETA** release of the IBM&reg; WebSphere&reg; Connect Voice Gateway for Watson&trade;.

IBM&reg; WebSphere&reg; Connect Voice Gateway for Watson&trade; provides a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) gateway into a set of orchestrated Watson services to automate or assist customer interactions. The voice gateway makes it possible to integrate a public or enterprise telephony system with Watson enabling direct voice interactions with a cognitive self-service agent or the ability to run real-time analytics on a phone call between two people (e.g.  a customer and a contact center agent).

Within this repository you will find the following two directories:

```
\docker
\bluemix
```
The **docker** directory contains sample **docker-compose.yml** files that can be used to launch the voice gateway docker images in your own docker environment.

The **bluemix** directory contains scripts and docker.env files that can be used to deploy the voice gateway to the IBM&reg; Containers for Bluemix&reg; service.
