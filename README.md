# sample.voice.gateway

This repository contains various samples and scripts to help you get started with the IBM&reg; Voice Gateway&trade;.

IBM&reg; Voice Gateway provides a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) endpoint that orchestrates IBM&reg; Watson&trade; speech and conversation services to enable a cognitive agent that communicates with a caller using natural language. The voice gateway makes it possible to integrate a public or enterprise telephony system with Watson, enabling direct voice interactions with a cognitive self-service agent or the ability to access real-time transcriptions of a phone call between two people (e.g.  a customer and a contact center agent).
